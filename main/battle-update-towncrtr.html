    <h2>What's the battle update though?</h2>
    <p>Glad you asked.</p>
    <p>TownCRTR Version 1.1 will readd an old feature from old TownCRTR's- but it will work this time! Yay!</p>
    <p>What is that feature, you're probably wondering? That feature is wars. Along with wars, we're fixing big bugs - you probably know which ones we're talking about... - And updating the Shop.</p>
    <p>The server will be in Maitenance Mode whilst the update is undergo. Don't worry, you can still play- at least as of right now you can.</p>
    <p>Hope to see you soon!</p>
