    <p>Hi! I'm Ethan, the owner, and developer of TownCRTR. Founder, also, as that's a tad important to the story.</p>
    <br>
    <h5 style="text-align:center">What inspired TownCRTR?</h5>
    <br>
    <p><i>Sometime in 2019,</i> "Dang.. ValkNet (valknet.minehut.gg) is so cool. Kinda inspiring.. Server host in a server host. <i>Wait!</i> A town creator! (I didn't know towny was a thing-) I went to the Minehut site, and bought a new server. I named it TownCreator, but it was too long. So, TownCRTR was born. CRTR meaning CReaToR. Now, I created it! Back then, I just wanted it *done*, and it showed. The spawn was ... ugly, made by me only, and rushed. The main script (skript) was buggy, and un-polished. Back then, I was also not as good with Skript, which made the process A) longer, and B) less ... good- certainly a thing, less-good. Anywho, it showed. My slacking showed, skills showed. Eventually, I redid the whole thing- hence V2. (current version as of making this is V2-3.1B, I believe.) Now, fast forward through many updates: we're here on Kingdoms.GG, though soon, we'll probably be moving ^v^</p>

    <p>Thanks for reading, Ethan</p>
