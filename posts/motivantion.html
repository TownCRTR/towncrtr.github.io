<h1 style="text-align:center">What's up with all these super short breaks?</h1>

<p>As you may- or may not know, I've been taking random & super short breaks, simply saying I'm "unmotivated".</p>
<h3>Why aren't you motivated?</h3>
<p>I feel like people don't really like the server as much as when it was on Minehut, and I have no clue what to do to A) keep people entertained & happy, & B) what updates to make to- again, keep people entertained & happy with the server.</p>
<h3>Why were you motivated in the first place?</h3>
<p>Well.., this will sound weird. - - - Basically I liked typing out what I updated.<p>
<br>
<p>But, the main actual reason is because I liked that the server made people happy, etc etc.</p>
<h3>Is this a way of saying you're going on <i>another</i> break?</h3>
<p>Nope! I'm gonna be pushing out updates, so no worries :)</p>
<br>

<p>Have fu playing, and thanks for reading, Ethan.</p>
