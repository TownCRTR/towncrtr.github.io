<h1 style="text-align:center">So, about SurvCRTR...</h1>

<p>As you may or may not know, I previously talked about me being bored of TownCRTR, wanting to turn it into SurvCRTR... I don't really think that's a good idea anymore, and in my opinion, it's kind of stupid- what's even stupider is turning a towny script (skript) into a random teleporter script. I don't think the change is worth it, I may put up a vote on it. Here are some pros & cons of each!</p>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center">Pros (of SurvCRTR)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>No more towny.</li>
	<li>...</li>
<ul>
<br>
<h4 style="text-align:center"> Cons (of SurvCRTR)</h4>
<ul>
	<li>nO MoRe tOwNy.</li>
	<li>Probably more fun, working, stealing mone- I mean, taxing people...</li>
	<li>Towny isn't original per se, but it's more rare. That may be a plus?</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, we'll see what happens. Thanks for reading, Ethan</p>
